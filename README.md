# Stepin_Mini Project
- A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. The simplest calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More sophisticated calculators can handle exponent ial operations, roots, logarithm s, trigonometric functions, and hyperbolic functions. Internally, some calculators actually perform all of these functions by repeated processes of addition.

## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. *Generation of makefile:* To overcome this problem research on makefiles was done.
2. *Unity testing:* Initially a few testcases did not pass, to overcome this issue debugging of program was performed.

## Learning Resources
1. [gcc makefile](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/cpp/gcc_make.html#zz-2.1)
2. [git inspector](https://github.com/ejwa/gitinspector.git)
3. [github workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-action)
